Our love for jewelry, especially handmade, is the reason we decided to create our workshop.\nChoosing the name was easy. We grew up in Kypseli, a neighborhood surrounded by wonderful architectural achievements and reflecting a pure urban community. We wanted to highlight this, with a fresh air, a new breath, but keeping the area's nobility.\nWe focus on the meaning of handmade, highlighting the imperfection that hands give, but also pay great attention to our materials. That's why we chose 925 silver & semi-precious stones for our products. We also want to have a wide variety of styles as the PNOI community expresses its diversity with many options, new techniques, colors, and designs, while maintaining the high quality of our products.\nFollow us and enjoy the journey.",
